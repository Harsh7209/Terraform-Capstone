## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **Flask-based web application** that I have **adopted from an open-source repository** and enhanced by implementing **DevSecOps practices** across the development lifecycle.

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate how security can be integrated into every phase of the DevOps pipeline — from development to deployment.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

> 🔹 This project was originally sourced from an open-source repository.  
> 🔹 I have adopted and extended it by implementing DevSecOps principles, tools, and automation.

## 🧠 What is DevSecOps?

DevSecOps is the practice of integrating **security into every stage of the software development lifecycle**, instead of treating it as a separate phase.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Flask (Python)
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Security Tools:** (Add tools like Trivy, Bandit, etc.)
- **Infrastructure:** (Optional – Kubernetes / AWS)
